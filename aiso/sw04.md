> Having formulated some problems, we now need to solve them. A solution is an action sequence, so search algorithms work by considering various possible action sequences. The  possible action sequences starting at the initial state form a **search tree** with the initial state at the root; the branches are actions and the **nodes** correspond to states in the state space of the problem - AIMA, Chapter 3.3 "Searching For Solutions"

We are following the example in the book; find a route from Arad to Bucharest:

First of all, we check if the current state is the goal state. Which is obviously not, but should solve problems such as: "starting in Arad, get to Arad". 

**Expanding** means to apply every allowed action to the current state. This generates a new set of states. In (a), we are expanding the current node $\text{In(Arad)}$ and thus generating new child nodes:  $\text{In(Sibiu)}, \text{In(Timisora)}, \text{In(Zerind)}$. In the next step, we need to explore which of these new nodes (possibilites) to consider (i.e. expand) further.

Figure (c) for example has choosen to go to Sibiu. First, we check again if we reached the goal state (we did not). Then, we expand Sibiu and create a new set of nodes. Now, we can choose to any of those or go back to Arand and choose Timisoara or Zerind.

The **frontier** is the set of all leaf nodes (nodes with no children in the tree). This means, that their children can just be unexplored for now. In our case, the frontier are the six white nodes in figure (c).

The process of expanding nodes on the frontier continues until either a solution is found or there are no more states to expand. Search algorithms all share this basic structure; they vary primarily  according to how they choose which state to expand nextâ€”the so-called **search strategy.**
